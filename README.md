# Portal f√ºr APV Aktivitas Tschugger Tag

## Initialization

To initialize the application and its database, run the following

```
# set up the SSL certificates using certbot
bash init-letsencrypt.sh
```

To initialize the database once, connect to the running DB container as follows:

```
docker exec -it tschugger_db_1 psql -U postgres
```

Then, create the user and DB:

```
CREATE USER tschugger;
CREATE DATABASE tschugger;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON tschugger TO tschugger;
```

## Run

After initialization the application is already running. If you make changes to the code and would like to rebuild and run the app, do

```
# shut down
docker-compose down

# rebuild and run
docker-compose up --build -d
```

The app is then running again with the changes.
